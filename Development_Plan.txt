# Employee Churn Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting employee churn using machine learning models, particularly Random Forest, to provide actionable insights for HR teams.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Deployment-ready Flask API.
- Model interpretability using SHAP.


## Usage
- Train the model: `python train.py`
- Predict churn: `python predict.py`
- Start Flask app: `python app.py`

## Files and Directories
- `data/`: Contains datasets and sample inputs.
- `models/`: Stores trained models.
- `logs/`: Application logs.
- `tests/`: Unit tests.
